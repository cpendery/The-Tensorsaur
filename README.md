# The-Tensorsaur
> A Project Using Tensor Flow to play a version of the Chrome Dinosaur Game

## Overview
This project's goal is to create an application to emmulate the Dinosaur Game using Python. Then, using Tensorflow produce a machine learning algorithm that is able to play the game based off of previously created data.

## Update in Process
We are moving over to OpenAI's Gym Environment for our game combined with a high level api to make the game faster, image capture easier, along with just streamlining the process. The Old Project is under LinearLearn_Deprecated
