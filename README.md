# The-Tensorsaur
> A Project Using Tensor Flow to play a version of the Chrome Dinosaur Game

## Overview
This project's goal is to create an application to emmulate the Dinosaur Game using Python. Then, using Tensorflow produce a machine learning algorithm that is able to play the game based off of previously created data.

## Reflection
Upon reflecting and working parallel with a group of Machine Learning interns this summer, I've realized that Wyatt and I have a lot to learn. This was a very interesting start that began with a minimal plan, tasking, and deliberable scheme. As a result, I'm currently working through [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do). I will be documenting this on my github along with my new LeetCode challenge. Please feel free to check out those projects.
