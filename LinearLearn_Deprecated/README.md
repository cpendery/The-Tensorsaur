# The-Tensorsaur
> A Project Using Tensor Flow to play a version of the Chrome Dinosaur Game

## Overview
This project's goal is to create an application to emmulate the Dinosaur Game using Python. Then, using Tensorflow produce a machine learning algorithm that is able to play the game based off of previously created data.

### To Run
The project is run on the scoreboard.py file
### To Control Overall Game
The project's controls for frame capture, frame rates, use of tensor flow, and data capture is all in the gameboard.py file
### To Clean the Data
The data must be cleaned before training, and this is done with the data_cleaner.py file

## Software Requirements
>This project requires the use of Pyglet, SkLearn, Tensorflow, Pandas, Numpy, and Python 3.6.8. It has only been run on Windows devices though Pyglet can support running on Linux devices
